# Top-Level Document content policy

Content policy for repository root documents (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md). This document defines what belongs in Top-Level Documents and how to decide what to move to other files. Purpose-specific guidelines (meta.README, meta.CONTRIBUTING) detail how to apply this when authoring each document.

## Definition

**Top-Level Document.** A main document at the repository root that readers encounter first (e.g. README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md). These documents carry the first impression and enable readers to take basic action.

## Core Visibility Principle

Top-Level Documents must contain the core priorities of the project. These include: non-negotiable conditions, project-defining trade-offs, cultural priorities, and rules whose misunderstanding would create high cost. High-priority items must not be reduced to links. Separation is based on priority, not length.

## Priority-Based Separation

When deciding whether to move content out of a Top-Level Document, ask:

- Is this read by almost everyone?
- Would misunderstanding this create recurring cost?
- Does this define the character of the project?

If the answer is yes, it belongs in the Top-Level Document.
