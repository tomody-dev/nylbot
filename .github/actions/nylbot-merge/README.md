### Command Options

| Option                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--override-approval-requirement` | **Exceptional/privileged option**: Skip the review approval requirement for this merge only. The command executor acts as a reviewer proxy, taking responsibility for approving the changes. All other checks (status checks, merge conflicts, unresolved threads, etc.) still apply. |

**Example with flag:**

```
/nylbot merge --override-approval-requirement
```

> [!CAUTION]
>
> **Important Notes on `--override-approval-requirement`:**
>
> - **This is an exceptional, privileged option**: Use this option sparingly and only when you have a valid reason to bypass the normal approval workflow.
> - **Command executor takes reviewer responsibility**: By using this flag, you are acting as a reviewer proxy and asserting that you have reviewed and approved the changes yourself.
> - **Temporary and explicit**: This override applies only to the current merge command invocation and does not change repository settings or branch protection rules.
> - **Limited scope**: This flag only bypasses the approval requirement. All other checks (merge conflicts, unresolved conversations, status checks, etc.) must still pass.
> - **Commit message marker**: When this flag is used and actually takes effect (i.e., when there are no valid approvals), the merge commit message will include a marker indicating the exceptional approval override.

## Merge Method Selection

The action automatically selects the appropriate merge method:

| Condition                   | Merge Method | Reason                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Head branch is `release/*`  | Merge commit | Preserve release history     |
| Head branch is `fix/sync/*` | Merge commit | Preserve back-merge history  |
| Base branch is `release/*`  | Squash       | Clean release branch history |
| Base branch is `develop`    | Squash       | Clean develop branch history |
| Otherwise                   | Merge commit | Default behavior             |

## Commit Message Behavior

nylbot-merge **explicitly specifies** both commit title and body to ensure consistent behavior regardless of repository settings for `merge_commit_title` and `merge_commit_message`.

### Merge Commits

For merge commits (used for `release/*` and `fix/sync/*` branches):

**Title (first line):**

```
Merge pull request #{PR_NUMBER} from {PR_MERGE_HEAD}
```

**Body (after blank line):**

```
{PR_TITLE}

{ADDITIONAL_MESSAGES}
```

**Example:**

```
Merge pull request #123 from release/v1.0.0

chore(release): Release v1.0.0

Merged-by: nylbot-merge (on behalf of @username)
```

### Squash Merges

For squash merges (used for PRs targeting `develop` or `release/*` branches):

**Title (first line):**

```
{PR_TITLE} (#{PR_NUMBER})
```

**Body (after blank line):**

```
* {COMMIT_TITLE_01}
* {COMMIT_TITLE_02}
* {COMMIT_TITLE_03}
...

Co-authored-by: {AUTHOR_NAME_01} <{AUTHOR_EMAIL_01}>
Co-authored-by: {AUTHOR_NAME_02} <{AUTHOR_EMAIL_02}>
...

{ADDITIONAL_MESSAGES}
```

**Notes:**

- Only commit titles (first line of each commit message) are listed, not full commit messages
- Each commit title is prefixed with `* ` (bullet point)
- Co-authors are extracted from all commits in the PR and listed in commit order (oldest ancestor &#x279C; most recent)
- Duplicate authors are included only once (first occurrence)
- Co-authored-by entries follow the Git trailer format: `Co-authored-by: Name <email>`

**Example:**

```
feat: add new authentication system (#456)

* feat: implement OAuth2 provider
* fix: handle token expiration
* docs: update authentication guide

Co-authored-by: Alice Developer <alice@example.com>
Co-authored-by: Bob Contributor <bob@example.com>

Merged-by: nylbot-merge (on behalf of @username)
```

### Special Commit Message Markers

When the `--override-approval-requirement` flag is used **and actually takes effect** (i.e., when there are no valid approvals), the merge commit message will include a marker in the additional messages section:

```
⚠️ EXCEPTIONAL MERGE: Approval requirement overridden via --override-approval-requirement
```

This marker is **not** added if the override flag was specified but didn't take effect (e.g., when there were already valid approvals).

## Pre-merge Checks

Before merging, the action validates:

1. ✅ PR is ready for review (open, unlocked, and not a draft)
2. ✅ All review conversations are resolved
3. ✅ At least one valid approval from another user
4. ✅ No merge conflicts
5. ✅ PR title follows Conventional Commits

### Check Status Icons

The merge check comment uses three icon states:

| Icon | Meaning                                                                                                          |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅   | Check passed                                                                                                     |
| ❌   | Check failed and blocks merge                                                                                    |
| ⚠️   | Check did not pass but is explicitly tolerated (e.g., overridden approval requirement or accepted title warning) |

## Quick Start

Create a caller workflow in your project (e.g., `.github/workflows/on-comment.yml`):

```yaml
name: on-comment

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

concurrency:
  group: on-comment-${{ github.event.issue.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  nylbot-merge:
    if: github.event.issue.pull_request
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
    steps:
      - uses: {ORG}/{REPO}/.github/actions/nylbot-merge@develop
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          # release_branch_prefix: "release/"
          # develop_branch: "develop"
          # sync_branch_prefix: "fix/sync/"
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Replace `{ORG}` with the organization or user name and `{REPO}` with the repository name where this action is hosted.
> - This Action has no stable release yet. Please use `@develop` until the first versioned tag becomes available.

## Permissions Required

The workflow must have the following permissions:
