/**
 * main.ts - Entry point for the nylbot-merge GitHub Action
 *
 * This file is the main entry point that runs in the GitHub Actions environment.
 * It is responsible for:
 * 1. Reading inputs from the GitHub Actions environment
 * 2. Constructing the event context from github.context
 * 3. Calling the main action logic from action.ts
 * 4. Setting outputs and writing summaries
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS UNTESTABLE:
 * ============================
 * This file contains ONLY GitHub Actions runtime integration code that:
 * 1. Depends on @actions/core global state (core.getInput, core.setOutput, core.summary)
 * 2. Depends on @actions/github global context (github.context, process.env)
 * 3. Has no business logic - only reads inputs, delegates to action.ts, and writes outputs
 *
 * TESTING APPROACH:
 * =================
 * - All business logic is in action.ts (executeAction, buildSummaryMarkdown) which IS fully tested
 * - This file is a thin integration layer with GitHub Actions runtime
 * - Testing this would require mocking the entire GitHub Actions environment, which provides
 *   no value since it only contains simple pass-through code with no conditional logic
 * - The real functionality is tested in action.test.ts with high coverage
 *
 * All testable logic has been moved to action.ts.

/**
 * Main function that runs the action.
 *
 * WHY THIS FUNCTION IS NOT TESTED:
 * =================================
 * This function is a thin wrapper that:
 * 1. Reads inputs from GitHub Actions environment (core.getInput)
 * 2. Reads context from GitHub Actions runtime (github.context, process.env)
 * 3. Delegates all business logic to executeAction() in action.ts (which IS tested)
 * 4. Writes outputs to GitHub Actions environment (core.setOutput, core.summary)
 *
 * Testing this function would require:
 * - Mocking @actions/core global state
 * - Mocking @actions/github global context
 * - Mocking process.env
 * - Setting up a complete GitHub Actions environment simulation
 *
 * This provides no value because:
 * - There is no conditional logic or business rules in this function
 * - It's purely an adapter between GitHub Actions runtime and our business logic
 * - The business logic (executeAction, buildSummaryMarkdown) is fully tested in action.test.ts
 * - Any bugs would be immediately visible when running the action in a real workflow
 *
 * COVERAGE IMPACT:
 * ================
 * - This file intentionally has 0% test coverage
 * - All testable business logic has been extracted to action.ts (high coverage)
 * - This separation follows the "Humble Object" pattern for testing
