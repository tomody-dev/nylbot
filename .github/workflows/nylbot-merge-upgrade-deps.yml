# =============================================================================
# nylbot-merge Dependency Upgrade Workflow
# =============================================================================
# This workflow automatically upgrades npm dependencies in the nylbot-merge
# action by running `npm run all:full-upgrade` and creating a PR with changes.
#
# TRIGGERS:
# - Manual trigger (`on.workflow_dispatch`)
# - Scheduled trigger (`on.schedule`)
#
# REQUIRED PERMISSIONS:
# - contents: write    - To push changes to a new branch
# - pull-requests: write - To create and manage PRs
#
# REQUIRED REPOSITORY SETTINGS:
# 1. Under Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions:
#    - Enable "Read and write permissions" OR
#    - Use a PAT (Personal Access Token) with repo scope
# 2. Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests (optional, for
#    better automation experience)
#
# WORKFLOW BEHAVIOR:
# 1. Checks out the repository
# 2. Runs `npm run all:full-upgrade`
# 3. Creates or updates a PR with dependency upgrades:
#    - Branch name is unique per base branch (e.g., bot/nylbot-merge-deps/develop)
#    - If no existing PR exists for this base branch, creates a new one
#    - If an existing PR exists for this base branch, updates it with the latest changes (force-push)
#    - If no changes are detected, the action automatically skips PR creation
#
# PR LABELING:
# - Automatically adds 'dependencies' label to the PR
# - You may customize labels by modifying the 'labels' input below
# =============================================================================

on:
  # Manual trigger
  # - By default, this workflow runs on the repository's default branch if executed without changing any settings.
  # - The target branch can be explicitly changed at execution time via the GitHub Actions UI.
  workflow_dispatch:

  # Scheduled trigger
  # - This workflow runs on the repository's default branch only.
  # - Branch selection is not supported for scheduled executions.
  schedule:
    # Runs every Saturday at 9:00 AM UTC
    - cron: '0 9 * * 6'

# Ensure only one nylbot-merge dependency upgrade workflow runs at a time per base branch
